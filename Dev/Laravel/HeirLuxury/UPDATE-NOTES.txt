Heir Luxury â€“ Update Notes

1) Product detail page now lives at: resources/views/products/show.blade.php
2) New reusable components:
   - resources/views/components/product/card.blade.php
   - resources/views/components/product/info-panel.blade.php
   - resources/views/components/product/coming-soon.blade.php
   - resources/views/components/product/meta.blade.php
   (legacy: resources/views/components/product-card.blade.php forwards to <x-product.card>)

3) Use the card component in any product grid:
   <x-product.card :product="$p" />

4) (Recommended) Consolidate catalog views under:
   resources/views/catalog/{search.blade.php, categories.blade.php, mega.blade.php}

5) Clear caches:
   php artisan view:clear && php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear
